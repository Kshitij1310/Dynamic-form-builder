# Dynamic Form Builder (React + TailwindCSS)
This is a small dynamic form builder that I created to practice React, form
handling, and working with localStorage. The app lets you create custom forms,
save them, preview them, and submit responses. Everything runs on the browser
without any backend.
##  How to Run the Project
